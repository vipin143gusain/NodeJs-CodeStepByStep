### Interview Questions & Answers (Node.js Fundamentals)

**1. Question:** What is a variable in programming?
    * **Simple Answer:** A variable is like a container or a box where you can store information, like a number, text, or a true/false value. You give it a name so you can use that information later.

**2. Question:** What is a function?
    * **Simple Answer:** A function is a block of code designed to do a specific task. You can "call" or "run" this block of code whenever you need that task done, often by giving it some input (called arguments) and getting an output.

**3. Question:** How do "if-else" statements work?
    * **Simple Answer:** "If-else" statements help your code make decisions. If a certain condition is true, one set of code runs. If that condition is false, a different set of code runs. It's like saying, "IF it's raining, take an umbrella, ELSE, enjoy the sun."

**4. Question:** What is the purpose of a loop?
    * **Simple Answer:** A loop is used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Instead of writing the same code over and over, you use a loop to tell the computer to do it automatically until a certain condition is met.

**5. Question:** What's an array in programming?
    * **Simple Answer:** An array is like a list or a collection of items. You can store several pieces of information (like a list of names or numbers) in a single variable, and each item has a position (index) that lets you find it.

**6. Question:** What is an object in JavaScript?
    * **Simple Answer:** An object is a way to store data in pairs of "name" and "value," like a dictionary. For example, a "person" object might have a "name" of "Vipin" and an "age" of "30." It helps you group related information together.

**7. Question:** Why do we import functions or files in JavaScript/Node.js?
    * **Simple Answer:** We import functions or files to reuse code. Instead of writing the same code in every file, you can write it once in a separate file and then "import" it into other files that need to use it. This keeps your code organized and easy to manage.

**8. Question:** What is Node.js in very simple terms?
    * **Simple Answer:** Node.js is a special environment that lets you run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, like on a server or your computer. It allows JavaScript to be used for things like building website backends or standalone tools.
