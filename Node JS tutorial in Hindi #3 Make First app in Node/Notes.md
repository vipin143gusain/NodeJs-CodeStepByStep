Here are some important interview questions and answers, explained in simple words, based on the Node.js tutorial video:

### Interview Questions & Answers

1.  **Question:** How do you run a simple JavaScript code file using Node.js?
    * **Answer:** You can open your terminal or command prompt, go to the folder where your JavaScript file is saved, and then type `node` followed by your file's name (e.g., `node app.js`). Node.js will then execute the code in that file.

2.  **Question:** What is the `console.log()` command used for in Node.js?
    * **Answer:** `console.log()` is like a message sender. You use it to print messages or the values of variables directly into your terminal. It's super helpful for checking what's happening in your code or for debugging.

3.  **Question:** What does REPL stand for in Node.js, and what is its purpose?
    * **Answer:** REPL stands for **Read-Eval-Print Loop**. It's a special mode in your terminal where you can type JavaScript code directly, hit Enter, and see the result immediately. It's great for quickly testing small pieces of code or trying out new JavaScript features without having to create a file first.

4.  **Question:** How do you include or "import" a module (like the File System module) in your Node.js application?
    * **Answer:** You use the `require()` function. For example, to use the File System module, you would write `const fs = require('fs');` at the top of your JavaScript file. This brings in the tools and functions from that module so you can use them in your code.

5.  **Question:** Can you give a very basic example of what the File System (FS) module in Node.js can do?
    * **Answer:** The File System (FS) module lets your Node.js application work with files and folders on your computer. A basic example is creating a new file. You can use a function like `fs.writeFileSync('hello.txt', 'Hello World!');` to create a file named `hello.txt` and put "Hello World!" inside it. This is useful for saving data or creating logs.
