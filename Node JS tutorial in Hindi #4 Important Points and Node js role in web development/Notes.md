Here are some important interview questions with simple answers, based on the Node.js tutorial video:

### Interview Questions & Answers (Node.js Basics)

1.  **Question:** What is the basic difference between server-side and client-side scripting?
    * **Answer:**
        * **Client-side scripting** (like JavaScript in a browser) runs directly on the user's computer or device. It's for things you see and interact with, like animations or form validations.
        * **Server-side scripting** (like Node.js) runs on a server, which is a powerful computer that stores website files and data. It handles things like storing user information, talking to databases, and processing complex requests before sending information to the user's device.

2.  **Question:** How does Node.js use JavaScript?
    * **Answer:** Node.js uses JavaScript outside of a web browser. It uses the same JavaScript engine that browsers use (Google's V8 engine) to run JavaScript code on the server. This means you can use one language, JavaScript, for both the frontend (what users see) and the backend (the server logic).

3.  **Question:** What is Node.js primarily used for in web development?
    * **Answer:** Node.js is mostly used for building **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**. These APIs act as messengers that send and receive data between different parts of an application, like between a website or mobile app and a database.

4.  **Question:** In simple terms, what is an API and why is it important?
    * **Answer:**
        * An **API** is like a waiter in a restaurant. When you order food (make a request), you don't go to the kitchen yourself. The waiter (API) takes your order to the kitchen (server/database) and brings back your food (data).
        * It's **important** because it allows different software programs (like a website, a mobile app, and a database) to talk to each other and share information in a structured way, making complex applications work smoothly.

5.  **Question:** Can you give an example of how an API built with Node.js would be used in a real application?
    * **Answer:** Imagine a social media app. When you create a new post on your phone, your mobile app sends that post data to a **Node.js API**. The Node.js API then takes that data, saves it in a database, and then sends a confirmation back to your mobile app. The same Node.js API can also be used by the website version of the app to show your posts, so your data is consistent across different platforms.
