**From the Video (and related to Node.js server creation and request/response):**

1.  **Question:** How do you create a simple HTTP server in Node.js?
    **Answer:** (Based on the video) You use the built-in `http` module. First, `require('http')` to import the module. Then, use `http.createServer()` to create a server instance. This takes a callback function with `req` (request) and `res` (response) parameters. Inside the callback, you handle the request and send a response using `res.writeHead()` to set headers and `res.end()` to send the response body (e.g., "Hello"). Finally, you use `server.listen()` to specify the port for the server to listen on.

2.  **Question:** What are the `req` (request) and `res` (response) objects in Node.js?
    **Answer:** (Based on the video) The `req` object represents the incoming HTTP request from the client. It contains information like the URL, headers, and any data sent by the client. The `res` object represents the HTTP response that your server will send back to the client. You use it to set headers, status codes, and the response body.

**General Node.js Interview Questions (from web search):**

1.  **Question:** What is Node.js, and how does it work?
    **Answer:** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, primarily for server-side applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient for handling concurrent requests.

2.  **Question:** Explain the event loop in Node.js.
    **Answer:** The event loop is a core mechanism in Node.js that handles asynchronous operations. It continuously checks the call stack and callback queue, executing tasks when they are ready. This enables Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations.

3.  **Question:** What is `npm`?
    **Answer:** npm (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript. It's used to install, update, and manage dependencies (libraries and tools) in Node.js projects.

4.  **Question:** What are streams in Node.js?
    **Answer:** Streams are a way to handle data in chunks, rather than loading the entire data into memory at once. Node.js has different types of streams: Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform.

5.  **Question:** What is middleware in Express.js?
    **Answer:** Middleware functions in Express.js have access to the request and response objects, and the next middleware function in the request-response cycle. They can execute code, modify the request or response, or end the cycle.

**Important Note:**

The video focuses on basic server creation using Node.js's built-in `http` module. It doesn't cover more advanced topics like Express.js, streams, or specific details about request/response objects in the context of Express.js. For a more comprehensive understanding of these topics, I recommend exploring resources specifically focused on Node.js and Express.js, such as the [official Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) and the [official Express.js documentation](https://expressjs.com/).
